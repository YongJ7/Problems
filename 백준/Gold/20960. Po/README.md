### 문제 설명

<p>Tinky Winky left a sequence of n zeroes in the Tubbytronic Superdome, and left for a walk with Dipsy. When he came back, he saw that a misdeed has been done. The sequence was changed, and Po was smiling mischeviously in the corner of the room.</p>

<p><em>Oh dear! Po, what have you done?!</em> – asked Tinky Winky in horror.</p>

<p><em>I enhanced the sequence!</em> – replied Po.</p>

<p>After cross-examination, it was established that Po did a number of enhancements on the sequence. In every enhancement, she took a <strong>segment</strong> of a sequence and <strong>increased</strong> all elements in the segment by some positive integer. Also, every two segments were either disjoint or one was completely contained in other.</p>

<p><em>How many enhancements have you done, Po?</em> – Laa-Laa inquired.</p>

<p><em>I really don’t know! I’m only sure I did the <strong>minimum</strong> number of enhancements possible to get this sequence!</em> – said Po exhaustedly.</p>

<p><em>Then it surely must be m!</em> – proclaimed Noo-Noo. (Noo-Noo is the Teletubies’ vacuum cleaner pet)</p>

<p>What number did Noo-Noo say?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), the length of the sequence.</p>

<p>The second line contains n nonnegative integers a<sub>i</sub> (0 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>), the sequence after Po’s enhancements.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output m, the minimum possible number of enhancements.</p>
